# Heart-Attack-Prediction

+ A heart attack occurs when an artery supplying your heart with blood and oxygen becomes blocked. Fatty deposits build up over time, forming plaques in your heart's arteries. 
  If a plaque ruptures, a blood clot can form and block your arteries, causing a heart attack.

+ This dataset consists of 14 features with about 303 rows.
